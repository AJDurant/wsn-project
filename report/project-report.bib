abstract = {Wireless sensor actor networks (WSANs) consist of a number of sensor nodes and actor nodes in a distributed network. Sensor nodes collect data from environment and report them to actor nodes or to a sink node. Actor nodes coordinate to take decisions and accordingly take suitable actions. To coordinate, actor nodes must communicate with each other through their network connections. Therefore, actor-actor connectivity is vital to coordination. A node failure may lead to network partitioning. This paper proposes a distributed mechanism for recovering the connectivity failures among actors in their partitioned network. Sensor nodes are used to temporarily and rapidly reestablish actor-actor connectivity long before this connectivity is permanently reestablished through movements of some actors. It is shown that the proposed mechanism increases the availability of connectivity while the actors connectivity undergoes repair by actor movement. Simulation results also show a comparatively lower time to repair for our approach.},

abstract = {Mobility has been introduced to sensor networks through the deployment of movable nodes. In movable wireless networks, network connectivity among the nodes is a crucial factor in order to relay data to the sink node, exchange data for collaboration, and perform data aggregation. However, such connectivity can be lost due to a failure of one or more nodes. Even a single node failure may partition the network, and thus, eventually reduce the quality and efficiency of the network operation. To handle this connectivity problem, we present PADRA to detect possible partitions, and then, restore the network connectivity through controlled relocation of movable nodes. The idea is to identify whether or not the failure of a node will cause partitioning in advance in a distributed manner. If a partitioning is to occur, PADRA designates a failure handler to initiate the connectivity restoration process. The overall goal in this process is to localize the scope of the recovery and minimize the overhead imposed on the nodes. We further extend PADRA to handle multiple node failures. The approach, namely, MDAPRA strives to provide a mutual exclusion mechanism in repositioning the nodes to restore connectivity. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is validated through simulation experiments.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor and actor networks (WSANs) additionally employ actor nodes within the wireless sensor network (WSN) which can process the sensed data and perform certain actions based on this collected data. In most applications, inter-actor coordination is required to provide the best response. This suggests that the employed actors should form and maintain a connected inter-actor network at all times. However, WSANs often operate unattended in harsh environments where actors can easily fail or get damaged. Such failures can partition the inter-actor network and thus eventually make the network useless. In order to handle such failures, we present a connected dominating set (CDS) based partition detection and recovery algorithm. The idea is to identify whether the failure of a node causes partitioning or not in advance. If a partitioning is to occur, the algorithm designates one of the neighboring nodes to initiate the connectivity restoration process. This process involves repositioning of a set of actors in order to restore the connectivity. The overall goal in this restoration process is to localize the scope of the recovery and minimize the movement overhead imposed on the involved actors.

abstract = {Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks (WSANs) engage mobile nodes with actuators to respond to certain events in inhospitable environments. The harsh surroundings make actors susceptible to failure. Tolerating occasional actor failure is very important to avoid degrading the performance. In some cases, multiple actors simultaneously fail which makes the recovery very challenging. In this paper, we propose a new recovery approach which can handle simultaneous failures in WSANs. The approach is based on ranking network nodes relevant to a pre-assigned root actor. Ranking creates a tree to be used for coordinating the recovery among nodes. To minimize the recovery overhead, the nodes are virtually grouped to clusters and each node is assigned a recovery weight as well as a nearby cluster member which serves as a gateway to lost nodes. Designation of cluster heads is based on the number of children in the recovery tree. The simulation results confirm the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed approach in restoring network connectivity and also show that on the average the incurred overhead is low compared to contemporary single-failure recovery approaches.},

abstract = {VisualSense is a modeling and simulation framework for wireless and sensor networks that builds on and leverages Ptolemy II. Modeling of wireless networks requires sophisticated representation and analysis of communication channels, sensors, ad-hoc networking protocols, localization strategies, media access control protocols, energy consumption in sensor nodes, etc. This modeling framework is designed to support a component-based construction of such models. It supports actor-oriented definition of network nodes, wireless communication channels, physical media such as acoustic channels, and wired subsystems. The software architecture consists of a set of base classes for defining channels and sensor nodes, a library of subclasses that provide certain specific channel models and node models, and an extensible visualization framework. Custom nodes can be defined by subclassing the base classes and defining the behavior in Java or by creating composite models using any of several Ptolemy II modeling environments. Custom channels can be defined by subclassing the WirelessChannel base class and by attaching functionality defined in Ptolemy II models. It is intended to enable the research community to share models of disjoint aspects of the sensor nets problem and to build models that include sophisticated elements from several aspects.},

This paper presents a novel application of search to both the WSN and safety domains; searching for combinations of failures that can cause a hazard and then reducing these to the minimum possible using a combination of automated search and manual refinement.

Our units must be “invisible” (camouflaged), very low energy, and must allow distributed local computation. Data rates are 1 to 100 bytes/second per node, but networks can be large — an early prototype had 60 nodes. Failures are expensive and we must exploit redundancy whenever possible. Nodes are stationary but for energy reasons may decline to participate in transmissions.We have designed two wireless routing protocols that satisfy these constraints. Multipath On-demand Routing (MOR) computes multiple optimal routes to avoid depleting the energy at any given node. Geometric Routing scales to large networks, relying on Geographic Routing when possible and on selected global information otherwise. We have simulated and are implementing both protocols.},

abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) consist of multiple distributed nodes each with limited resources. With their strict resource constraints and application-specific characteristics, WSNs contain many challenging trade-offs. This thesis is concerned with the load balancing of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). We present an approach, inspired by bees' pheromone propagation mechanism, that allows individual nodes to decide on the execution process locally to solve the trade-off between service availability and energy consumption. We explore the performance consequences of the pheromone-based load balancing approach using a system-level simulator. The effectiveness of the algorithm is evaluated on case studies based on sound sensors with different scenarios of existing approaches on variety of different network topologies. The performance of our approach is dependant on the values chosen for its parameters. As such, we utilise the Simulated Annealing to discover optimal parameter configurations for pheromone-based load balancing technique for any given network schema. Once the parameter values are optimised for the given network topology automatically, we inspect improving the pheromone-based load balancing approach using robotic agents. As cyber-physical systems benefit from the heterogeneity of the hardware components, we introduce the use of pheromone signalling-based robotic guidance that integrates the robotic agents to the existing load balancing approach by guiding the robots into the uncovered area of the sensor field. As such, we maximise the service availability using the robotic agents as well as the sensor nodes.},

It is rather complex, or even unfeasible, to model analytically a WSN and it usually leads to oversimplified analysis with limited confidence. Besides, deploying test-beds supposes a huge effort. Therefore, simulation is essential to study WSN. However, it requires a suitable model based on solid assumptions and an appropriate framework to ease implementation. In addition, simulation results rely on the particular scenario under study (environment), hardware and physical layer assumptions, which are not usually accurate enough to capture the real behavior of a WSN, thus, jeopardizing the credibility of results. However, detailed models yields to scalability and performance issues, due to the large number of nodes, that depending on application, have to be simulated. Therefore, the tradeoff between scalability and accuracy becomes a major issue when simulating WSN. In this survey a suitable model for WSN simulation is introduced, together with guidelines for selecting an appropriate framework. In addition, a comparative description of available tools is provided.},

Restrictions on the programming model allow the nesC compiler to perform whole-program analyses, including data-race detection (which improves reliability) and aggressive function inlining (which reduces resource consumption).nesC has been used to implement TinyOS, a small operating system for sensor networks, as well as several significant sensor applications. nesC and TinyOS have been adopted by a large number of sensor network research groups, and our experience and evaluation of the language shows that it is effective at supporting the complex, concurrent programming style demanded by this new class of deeply networked systems.},

abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are often deployed to serve mission-critical applications in inhospitable environments such as battlefield and territorial borders. Inter-node communication is essential for WSNs to effectively fulfill their tasks. In hostile setups, the WSN may be subject to damage that severs the network connectivity and disrupts the application. The network must be able to recover from the failure and restore connectivity so that the designated tasks can be carried out. Given the unattended operation of the network, the recovery should be performed autonomously. In this paper we present AuR, an algorithm for Autonomous Repair of damaged WSN topologies. AuR operates in a distributed manner to restore connectivity in the event of multiple node failures. The design principle of AuR is based on modeling connectivity between neighboring nodes as a modified electrostatic interaction based on Coulomb's law between charges. The recovery process is initiated locally at nodes that have lost neighbors. These nodes spearhead the movement in the direction of loss so as to reconnect with other disjoint nodes. The performance of the algorithm is validated through simulation. I.},

abstract = {Modern factory facilities are characterized by highly flexible manufacturing cells and highly dynamic processes, where clusters of fixed or moving sensors and actuators have to be controlled in a limited space under stringent real-time and reliability constraints. In such demanding industrial environments, wireless systems can also be beneficial by improving flexibility, cutting cables, and enabling solutions, which are cumbersome or even not possible to realize with wireline systems, especially in controlling moving or rotating parts. In this paper, we present a conceptual study of a wireless real-time system dedicated for remote sensor/actuator control in production automation. System development is based on user requirements, which were extracted from customer interviews and a market research. Low level measurements of frequency- and space-selective wireless channels in a factory-like environment were carried out. System design aspects, i.e., network topology, multiple access schemes, and radio technologies, will be thoroughly reviewed. The performance of a first prototype implementation will be discussed with emphasis on timing behavior and power consumption, as sensors and actuators of the wireless system are intended to operate without power lines or batteries},

abstract = {A wireless sensor network is composed of multifunctional sensor nodes scattered in sensing fields. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are widely used in applications like Military, Environmental monitoring, Health (Scanning), Space Exploration, Smart homes, Mechanical stress levels of attached objects, disaster management etc. [30] The transmission of information is a tedious task in WSN due to miniaturization of resources such as limited battery life, transmission power, etc. Moreover, the deployment of WSN in remote and hostile locations makes them vulnerable to unreliable communication links and numerous security attacks. In the lieu of this, design of routing protocols should take into consideration various design issues and routing challenges. Considering the importance of fact, various routing protocols have been presented in the literature for WSN. Four main categories of routing protocols, namely location based, data centric, hierarchical and multipath based protocols are covered in this paper. A comprehensive survey of different routing protocols presented in the literature for WSNs is presented in this paper. Later on, we discuss various design challenges of WSN, advantages, disadvantages and performance obstacles related to each routing protocol. Some open research issues are presented in the paper conclusion.},

abstract = {Most research on the lifetime of wirelesssensornetworks has focused primarily on the energy depletion of the very first node. In this study, we analyze the entire aging process of the sensornetwork in a periodic data gathering application. In sparse node deployments, it is observed that the existence of multiple alternate paths to a sink leads to a power law relation between connectivity to a sink and hop levels, where the probability of connection to a sink decreases in proportion to the hop level with an exponent, when device failures occur over time. Then, we provide distance-level analysis for the dense deployment case by taking into account the re-construction of a data gathering tree and workload shift caused by the energy depletion of nodes with larger workload. Extensive simulation results obtained with a realistic wireless link model are compared to our analytical results. Finally, we show through an analysis of the aging of first-hop nodes that increasing node density with a fixed radio range does not affect the network disconnection time.},

The lifetime of sensor devices depends on the device failure rate and/or battery energy depletion, and surviving nodes may not preserve the uniform node density across the network as nodes age. We first examine the general node aging problem by considering the energy consumption rate and the node failure rate. The energy consumption rate in a data gathering tree is presented with or without data aggregation. The nodes in each hop level show a di{\#}erent energy depletion rates even with data aggregation, which is studied by mathematical analysis as well as simulation results. Then, the resulting non-uniform connectivity over time in a data gathering tree is examined with a node's survivor function. It is shown by mathematical analysis and simulation results that the node aging process has a significant impact on the connectivity as the hop distance increases.},

We propose an approach, inspired by the immune system, that allows individual nodes to detect, diagnose and recover from different failures by switching between different protocols using a multi-modal switching mechanism. A causal link between different failures in WSN is identified. Existing fault tolerance in WSNs approaches are examined. From the survey, it is identified that various attempts have been made to improve the fault tolerance of the communication protocol especially in the routing protocols. Although tests have been performed to evaluate the communication protocols prior to deployment, failures in WSNs are still being reported when deployed in real environments. A Systematic Protocol Evaluation Technique (SPET) is proposed and applied to evaluate the dependability of the proposed multi-modal protocol and reduce the uncertainties in the experiment and to demonstrate the confidence in the measurements taken from experiments.},

Most successful sniper-detecting systems are based on acoustic measurements. We develop an acoustic system that works well even in complex urban environments. Funded through the Network Embedded Systems Technology program of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Information Exploitation Office, the PinPtr system uses a wireless network of many low-cost sensors to determine both a shooter's location and the bullet's trajectory by measuring both the muzzle blast and the shock wave. The PinPtr sensor-fusion algorithm, which runs on a base station, performs a search on a hyper-surface defined by a consistency function. This function provides the number of sensor measurements that are consistent with hypothetical shooter positions and shot times. The algorithm automatically classifies measurements and eliminates those that result from multipath effects or are otherwise erroneous. A fast search algorithm finds the global maximum of the surface, which corresponds to the shooter position.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks consist of small battery powered devices with limited energy resources. Once deployed, the small sensor nodes are usually inaccessible to the user, and thus replacement of the energy source is not feasible. Hence, energy efficiency is a key design issue that needs to be enhanced in order to improve the life span of the network. Several network layer protocols have been proposed to improve the effective lifetime of a network with a limited energy supply. In this article we propose a centralized routing protocol called Base-Station Controlled Dynamic Clustering Protocol (BCDCP), which distributes the energy dissipation evenly among all sensor nodes to improve network lifetime and average energy savings. The performance of BCDCP is then compared to clustering-based schemes such as Low- Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH), LEACH- centralized (LEACH-C), and Power-Efficient Gathering in Sensor Information Systems (PEGASIS). Simulation results show that BCDCP reduces overall energy consumption and improves network lifetime over its comparatives. Introduction},

The idea and the attributes of a Wireless Sensor Network require designers to apply different techniques than those hitherto used in wired as well as in wireless networks. The dynamic progress in the field of WSNs entails the need of creating simulators that have more specific capabilities. Such simulation tools should allow researchers to verify new ideas and compare the proposed solutions in a virtual environment helping to avoid unnecessary, time-consuming or expensive hardware implementations. When beginning to work with Wireless Sensor Networks, it is important to choose a simulation environment that will be up to requirements and will allow the researcher to conduct experiments in a given area.

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks have gained considerable attention in the past few years. They have found application domains in battlefield communication, homeland security, pollution sensing, and traffic monitoring. As such, there has been an increasing need to define and develop simulation frameworks for carrying out high-fidelity WSN simulation. In this article we present a modeling, simulation, and emulation framework for WSNs in J-Sim - an open source, component-based compositional network simulation environment developed entirely in Java. This framework is built on the autonomous component architecture and extensible internetworking framework of J-Sim, and provides an object-oriented definition of target, sensor, and sink nodes, sensor and wireless communication channels, and physical media such as seismic channels, mobility models, and power models (both energy-producing and energy-consuming components). Application-specific models can be defined by subclassing classes in the simulation framework and customizing their behaviors. We also include in J-Sim a set of classes and mechanisms to realize network emulation. We demonstrate the use of the proposed WSN simulation framework by implementing several well-known localization, geographic routing, and directed diffusion protocols, and perform performance comparisons (in terms of the execution time incurred and memory used) in simulating WSN scenarios in J-Sim and ns-2. The simulation study indicates the WSN framework in J-Sim is much more scalable than ns-2 (especially in memory usage). We also demonstrate the use of the WSN framework in carrying out real-life full-fledged Future Combat System (FCS) simulation and emulation},

abstract = {Despite enormous progress in networking technologies, their application has remained restricted and computing to conventional person-to-person and person-to-computer communication. However, continual reduction in cost and form factor is now making it possible to imbed networking - even wireless networking - and computing capabilities not just in our PCs and laptops but also other objects. Further, a marriage of these ever tinier and cheaper processors and wireless network interfaces with emerging micro-sensors based on MEMS technology is allowing cheap sensing, processing, and communication capabilities to be unobtrusively embedded in familiar physical objects. The result is an emerging paradigm shift where the primary role of information technology would be to enhance or assist in “person to physical world” communication via familiar physical objects with embedded (a) micro-sensors to react to external stimuli, and (b) wireless networking and computing engines for tetherless communication with compute servers and other networked embedded objects. In this paper we present the application of sensor-based wireless networks to a “Smart Kindergarten” that we are developing to target developmental problem-solving environments for early childhood education. This is a natural application as young children learn by exploring and interacting with objects such as toys in their environment. Our envisioned system would enhance the education process by providing a childhood learning environment that is individualized to each child, adapts to the context, coordinates activities of multiple children, and allows continual unobtrusive evaluation of the learning process by the teacher. This would be done by wirelessly-networked, sensor-enhanced toys and other classroom objects with back-end middleware database services techniques. We explore middleware, and data management technologies for realizing this application, and describe challenges wireless arising distributed structure, unreliable sensing, large scale/density, and and networking, from ad hoc novel sensor data types that are characteristic of such deeply instrumented environments with inter-networked physical objects.},

abstract = {US water utilities are faced with mounting operational and maintenance costs as a result of aging pipeline infrastructures. Leaks and ruptures in water supply pipelines and blockages and overflow events in sewer collectors cost millions of dollars a year, and monitoring and repairing this underground infrastructure presents a severe challenge. In this paper, we discuss how wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can increase the spatial and temporal resolution of operational data from pipeline infrastructures and thus address the challenge of near real-time monitoring and eventually control. We focus on the use of WSNs for monitoring large diameter bulk-water transmission pipelines. We outline a system, PipeNet, we have been developing for collecting hydraulic and acoustic/vibration data at high sampling rates as well as algorithms for analyzing this data to detect and locate leaks. Challenges include sampling at high data rates, maintaining aggressive duty cycles, and ensuring tightly time-synchronized data collection, all under a strict power budget. We have carried out an extensive field trial with Boston Water and Sewer Commission in order to evaluate some of the critical components of PipeNet. Along with the results of this preliminary trial, we describe the results of extensive laboratory experiments which are used to evaluate our analysis and data processing solutions. Our prototype deployment has led to the development of a reusable, field-reprogrammable software infrastructure for distributed high-rate signal processing in wireless sensor networks, which we also describe.

abstract = {An effective approach for energy conservation in wireless sensor networks is scheduling sleep intervals for extraneous nodes, while the remaining nodes stay active to provide continuous service. For the sensor network to operate successfully, the active nodes must maintain both sensing coverage and network connectivity. Furthermore, the network must be able to configure itself to any feasible degrees of coverage and connectivity in order to support different applications and environments with diverse requirements. This paper presents the design and analysis of novel protocols that can dynamically configure a network to achieve guaranteed degrees of coverage and connectivity. This work differs from existing connectivity or coverage maintenance protocols in several key ways: 1) We present a Coverage Configuration Protocol (CCP) that can provide different degrees of coverage requested by applications. This flexibility allows the network to self-configure for a wide range of applications and (possibly dynamic) environments. 2) We provide a geometric analysis of the relationship between coverage and connectivity. This analysis yields key insights for treating coverage and connectivity in a unified framework: this is in sharp contrast to several existing approaches that address the two problems in isolation. 3) Finally, we integrate CCP with SPAN to provide both coverage and connectivity guarantees. We demonstrate the capability of our protocols to provide guaranteed coverage and connectivity configurations, through both geometric analysis and extensive simulations.},

abstract = {Sensor deployment is a critical issue since it reflects the cost and detection capability of a wireless sensor network. Although lots of work has addressed this issue, most of them assume that the sensing field is an open space and there is a special relationship between the communication range and sensing range of sensors. In this work, we consider the sensing field as an arbitrary-shaped region possibly with obstacles. Besides, we allow an arbitrary relationship between the communication range and sensing range, thus eliminating the constraints of existing results. Our approach is to partition the sensing field into smaller sub-regions based on the shape of the field, and then to deploy sensors in these sub-regions. Simulation results show that our method requires fewer sensors compared to existing results.},

abstract = {Sensor failures or oversupply in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), especially initial random deployment, create both spare sensors (whose area is fully covered by other sensors) and sensing holes. We envision a team of robots to relocate sensors and improve their area coverage. Existing algorithms, including centralized ones and the only localized G-R3S2, move only spare sensors and have limited improvement be- cause non-spare sensors, with area coverage mostly overlapped by neighbour sensors, are not moved, and additional sensors are deployed to fill existing holes. We propose a localized algorithm, called Localized Ant-based Sensor Relocation Algorithm with Greedy Walk (LASR-G), where each robot may carry at most one sensor and makes decision that depends only on locally detected information. In LASR-G, each robot calculates corresponding pickup or dropping probability, and relocates sensor with currently low coverage contribution to another location where sensing hole would be significantly reduced. The basic algorithm optimizes only area coverage, while modi- fied algorithm includes also the cost of robot movement. We compare LASR-G with G-R3S2, and examine both single robot and multi robots scenarios. The simulation results show the advantages of LASR-G over G-R3S2.},

abstract = {This paper considers the energy minimization problem in a multi-hop wireless ad hoc network that consists of regular nodes and mobile relays. In such a network, mobile relays may relocate to optimal positions such that energy consumption for data transmission isminimized. In order to find the optimal positions for mobile relays, the mobile relay optimal relocation (MROR) problem is first defined. Since the cost in terms of data transmission energy can be modeled using a convex function, the problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem over mobile relay position variables. Using dual decomposition and subgradient methods enables mobile relays to cooperate in a distributed manner to attain the optimal relocations. Numerical results confirm that the proposed method can result in minimal energy consumption for data transmission. This study appears to be the first attempt to relocate mobile relays to globally minimize data transmission energy consumption in a multi-hop wireless network where multiple data flows exist.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in the applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In some of these applications, such as search and rescue and battlefield reconnaissance, a set of mobile nodes is deployed in order to collectively survey an area of interest and/or perform specific surveillance tasks. Such collaboration among the sensors requires internode interaction and thus maintaining network connectivity is critical to the effectiveness of WSNs. While connectivity can be provisioned at startup time and then sustained through careful coordination when nodes move, a sudden failure of a node poses a challenge since the network may get partitioned. This paper presents RIM; a distributed algorithm for Recovery through Inward Motion. RIM strives to efficiently restore the network connectivity after a node failure. Instead of performing a networkwide analysis to assess the impact of the node failure and orchestrate a course of action, RIM triggers a local recovery process by relocating the neighbors of the lost node. In addition to minimizing the messaging overhead, RIM opts to reduce the distance that the individual nodes have to travel during the recovery. The correctness of the RIM algorithm is proven and the incurred overhead is analyzed. The performance of RIM is validated through simulation experiments.},

Although many solutions have been proposed, few of them can be used in real applications because of their high cost, low accuracy or infeasibility due to practical is- sues. In this paper, we propose a practical acoustic localization scheme called Thunder. Thunder employs an asymmetric architecture and shifts most of the complexities and hard- ware requirements from each node to a single powerful centralized device. The solution is efficient, and requires virtually zero cost in terms of extra per node hardware and in- network communication. This paper also presents an efficient scheduling algorithm called Equilateral Triangle Scheduling to schedule Thunder for very large sensor networks and a resilient algorithm called Adaptive Fuzzy Clustering to provide robust localization without sacrificing efficiency in the presence of a high percentage of large ranging errors. To vali- date and evaluate Thunder, we built an experimental localization systembased on theMica2 platform, which achieved localization errors of about 1 meter in medium scale localization experiments.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the impact of radio irregularity on the communication performance in wireless sensor networks. Radio irregularity is a common phenomenon which arises from multiple factors, such as variance in RF sending power and different path losses depending on the direction of propagation. From our experiments, we discover that the variance in received signal strength is largely random; however, it exhibits a continuous change with incremental changes in direction. With empirical data obtained from the MICA2 platform, we establish a radio model for simulation, called the Radio Irregularity Model (RIM). This model is the first to bridge the discrepancy between spherical radio models used by simulators and the physical reality of radio signals. With this model, we are able to analyze the impact of radio irregularity on some of the well-known MAC and routing protocols. Our results show that radio irregularity has a significant impact on routing protocols, but a relatively small impact on MAC protocols. Finally, we propose six solutions to deal with radio irregularity. We evaluate two of them in detail. The results obtained from both the simulation and a running testbed demonstrate that our solutions greatly improve communication performance in the presence of radio irregularity.},
