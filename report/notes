conclusions

focus on what the community has done

amount of mobility & cost

use diagrams for protocols - expand on their results and conclusions


part of feasibility - economic cost
requirements from other algorithms eg localisation



centralised approaches tend to focus on energy efficient routing / deployment



if you can choose your deployment locations - eg within a building - an a priori centralised deployment plan will produce the best network for beginning with.
if you are in an open and/or changing environment non-priori distributed management of the network will be more successful as it can adapt.
however once any network is running it may need to adapt.
