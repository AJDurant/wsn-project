intro
applications
metrics
approaches
review of evaluation methods
- benefits and drawbacks of sim / real
conclusions

focus on what the community has done

amount of mobility & cost

use diagrams for protocols - expand on their results and conclusions


part of feasibility - economic cost
requirements from other algorithms eg localisation



centralised approaches tend to focus on energy efficient routing / deployment



if you can choose your deployment locations - eg within a building - an a priori centralised deployment plan will produce the best network for beginning with.
if you are in an open and/or changing environment non-priori distributed management of the network will be more successful as it can adapt.
however once any network is running it may need to adapt.



what assumptions have been made over reliability - what has been done to achieve reliability

what advantages and disadvantages are there in their proposal
critical analysis over what a protocol provides - figures on energy consumption etc.

advantages and disadvantages of dist/central

what that the actual failures, how do you know they have actually occurred / are just transient

metrics:
- time to recovery
- energy consumption
- energy wastage?
- external dependencies?
what are used by the papers, and why?
ranking / comparison in a table

is there a metrics survey paper?

conclusions:
advantages/disadvantages - showing application dependence
key points of metrics and evaluation


document design choices - why visual sense, why not viptos etc.


Simulation:

potential for looking at optimisation of models and performance

transient failures
power from data-sheets
multi-hop
realistic channel - collisions etc
java code for comms - otherwise it will be a mess
mobility

execution time - allows performance measurement
