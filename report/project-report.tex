\abstract{ \LaTeXe\ is a document markup and processing system built
  upon Donald Knuth's type-setting system, \TeX.
   
  \lstinline|UoYCSproject| is a \LaTeXe\ class for producing reports
  describing projects taken as part of a taught course in the
  Department of Computer Science at the University of York.  (It is
  not designed for research degree reports.)
  
  A brief introduction to \LaTeXe\ is given.  The
  \lstinline|UoYCSproject| class is described.
  
  This document itself is (inappropriately) an example of the use of
  the class \lstinline|UoYCSproject|.
